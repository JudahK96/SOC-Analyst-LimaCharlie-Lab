# SOC Analyst LimaCharlie EDR Lab

## Objective
The scope of this project was to create a home lab of virtual machines. The Kali-Linux VM as the attacker and the WindowVM as the victim. I used LimaCharlie EDR and Sysmon to work as my threat detection engine as well as track incoming telemetry and for logging. I used Sliver to generate C2 payloads, implant harmful files and operate the host machine in the background.

### Skills Learned

- Completely disable Defender on Windows
- Set up LimaCharlie EDR and Sysmon
- Silver to implant and activate .exe files
- Build D&R rules based on events
- Block attacks with custom rules

### Tools Used

- Virtualbox/ KaliLinux2024/ Windows 10
- LimaCharlie EDR/ Sliver Server/ Sysmon
